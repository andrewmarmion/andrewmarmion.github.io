It is not as intuitive as it could be and there are lots of pitfalls that you can unstick you. I am going to do a series of posts about Core Data.</p><p>So let's dive in.</p><p>Firstly you can allow Xcode to setup Core Data for you. This is a double edged sword. It is bad because it hides a lot of the complexity from you making it hard to understand what is happening but it is also good because it hides a lot of the complexity from you allowing you to get started quickly.</p><p>We aren't going to let Xcode do all the work for us, but we will let it handle our managed objects. So let's begin by creating a new iOS app and selecting SwiftUI.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/HyOSUZX.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HyOSUZX.png" title="App Type" style="width:400px;" />
</a><br /><br /><p>I am using Xcode 12.3 and the new SwiftUI App lifecycle methods. Not <strong>do not</strong> check the Core Data checkbox, we are going to set it up ourselves. Note that I have named the app BasicCoreData. You can give it whatever name you like.</p><p>I would suggest <strong>NOT</strong> calling it CoreData as that may cause some issues as we are using the CoreData framework it can cause the compiler to get confused. But prepending it with Basic works just fine.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/CciBx0v.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CciBx0v.png" title="App Details" style="width:400px;"/>
</a><br /><br /><p>Once you have done that click next and save your project, you can save it on the desktop if that is easiest.</p><p>Next we need to add the Data Model to the project. This is where you can manage your Entities, the objects that are stored.</p><p>So making sure you have ContentView highlighted (this is so that the file is added in the correct place) press CMD + N or you can go File -&gt; New -&gt; File. This brings up the new file template selector, from here we can add lots of different file types. We want to add a Data Model. So type "model" in the search box on the top right and it will filter our options. Select Data Model and click next.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/sGET3Oj.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sGET3Oj.png" title="Data Model" style="width:400px;"/>
</a><br /><br /><p>Now you have to enter a name for your Data Model. Xcode defaults to Model, which we will use here, but you can call it whatever you like. Previously Xcode used to name it after your app so in our case it would have been called BasicCoreData.</p><p>Once you have entered the name you want, press next.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/x8ZFkqB.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/x8ZFkqB.png" title="Naming the data model" style="width:400px;"/>
</a><br /><br /><p>Now that you have a Data Model in your project, your Project Navigator should look like this.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/d24nNzZ.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/d24nNzZ.png" title="Project Navigator with Data Model"/>
</a><br /><br /><p>We are going to need to add one more file to our project before we get everything working. Add a new file, this time choosing a Swift file. Name it <code>Storage.swift</code></p><p>Your Project Navigator should now look like this.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zH04agP.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zH04agP.png" title="Project Navigator with Storage.swfit" />
</a><br /><br /><p>Now that are all the files we need for this added we are going to. Create our first Entity.</p><p>If you click on the <code>Model.xcdatamodeld</code> in your Project Navigator you should see the following.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lK8DG9I.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lK8DG9I.png" title="The model with no entities" style="width:400px;" />
</a><br /><br /><p>This is where you add your Entities (basically the models that we want to store in Core Data). We can do a lot here but we are going to just create a very simple Entity. It will be called Person and have one attiribute: name.</p><p>Down at the bottom you will see a circular button with a big plus sign in the middle of it. This is the <code>Add Entity</code> button. Give it a tap and you should see an entry appear in the top left (called Entity). Double clicking on the name Entity allows us to change it to what we want. So change it to Person.</p><p>Next we are going to add the attribute. These are the data values on your entity/model. So click the plus button under the Attributes table and it will add a new attribute called <code>attribute</code> and a type of <code>Undefined</code>. Double click the attribute and change it to <code>name</code> and change its type to String. We are almost done. If you cannot see the Data Model Inspector CMD + OPTION + 4 to make it appear. Make sure that you make the Optional checkbox is unchecked.</p><p>Unchecking the Optional checkbox tells Xcode that we want the value that is stored in CoreData to not be optional (there is another gotcha coming up but we will discuss it when we get to it). This just means that we cannot create a Person entity with name that is nil.</p><p>So you should be looking at something like this.</p><br /><a href="https://i.imgur.com/jXm8lOD.png">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jXm8lOD.png" title="Entity has been added" style="width:400px;" />
</a><br /><br /><p>Now let's build the project, press CMD + B. Xcode now does a little magic for us. It secretly creates the data structure for the Person entity that we just setup. It is possible to do this manually and I will go over that in an upcoming post, but for a simple app we don't need to worry about that additional complexity.</p><p>So far we have got ourselves to a place where we are ready to start writing some code. Lets begin with our Storage.swift file.</p><p>Inside here we are going to create a class that will load the Data Model we created and allow us to add and remove Person entities to it.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">class</span> Storage {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> persistentContainer: <span class="type">NSPersistentContainer</span>

    <span class="keyword">init</span>() {
        persistentContainer = <span class="type">NSPersistentContainer</span>(name: <span class="string">"Model"</span>)

        persistentContainer.<span class="call">loadPersistentStores</span> { storeDescription, error <span class="keyword">in
            if let</span> error = error {
                <span class="call">fatalError</span>(<span class="string">"Unable to load Core Data. Error:</span> \(error)<span class="string">"</span>)
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>So what have we done here? Well we have created an instance of NSPersistentContainer and passing it the name of the Data Model we created as a string. Make sure you type it correctly as it will cause a crash if you get it wrong. Once we have created the instance of NSPersistentContainer we the load the persistent stores. This loads Core Data's underlying stores, where it persists your data.</p><p>Now that we have that we want to add two functions to our class. One to fetch all the Person entities and one to add a new Person entity.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> fetchPeople() -&gt; [<span class="type">Person</span>] {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> fetchRequest: <span class="type">NSFetchRequest</span>&lt;<span class="type">Person</span>&gt; = <span class="type">Person</span>.<span class="call">fetchRequest</span>()

    <span class="keyword">do</span> {
        <span class="keyword">return try</span> persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>.<span class="call">fetch</span>(fetchRequest)
    } <span class="keyword">catch</span> {
        <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Unable to fetch people:</span> \(error)<span class="string">"</span>)
        <span class="keyword">return</span> []
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>The above code creates an NSFetchRequest. The request there is straight forward and will return all Person entities that are stored. As fetch requests can throw we need to make sure we wrap it in a <code>do/catch</code> block in case it fails for any reason. If it does fail we will handle it gracefully and return and empty array.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> savePerson(with name: <span class="type">String</span>) {
    <span class="keyword">let</span> person = <span class="type">Person</span>(context: persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>)
    person.<span class="property">name</span> = name

    <span class="keyword">do</span> {
        <span class="keyword">try</span> persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>.<span class="call">save</span>()
        <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Saved person named:</span> \(name)<span class="string">"</span>)
    } <span class="keyword">catch</span> {
        persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>.<span class="call">rollback</span>()
        <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Unable to save person:</span> \(error)<span class="string">"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>Saving a person to Core Data is quite straight forward. First we create a Person passing it the current context. We then update its name to be the name that we want. Again saving can throw so we wrap this in a <code>do/catch</code> block. Note that if we fail to save we rollback the changes that we just made.</p><p>With Core Data you can make whatever changes you like, but they are not committed until you actually save them. The rollback drops all the current changes. Think of it like an Etch-a-Sketch, we can draw and draw on it but if we don't like what we have drawn we can shake it hard and we lose everything that we drew. This is what rollback does, it drops all the changes. Use it carefully, in our simple app using it here is fine.</p><p>Next we need to write some code to show that it works. Let's move over to <code>ContentView.swift</code>.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {

    <span class="keyword">let</span> storage: <span class="type">Storage</span>

    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Hello, world!"</span>)
            .<span class="call">padding</span>()
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>Add a storage property to your ContentView, like I have done above. This will cause a compiler error in the preview and in the BasicCoreDataApp. We can fix this by updating them respectively to be:</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView_Previews: <span class="type">PreviewProvider</span> {
    <span class="keyword">static var</span> previews: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">ContentView</span>(storage: <span class="type">Storage</span>())
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">@main
struct</span> BasicCoreDataApp: <span class="type">App</span> {
    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">Scene</span> {
        <span class="type">WindowGroup</span> {
            <span class="type">ContentView</span>(storage: <span class="type">Storage</span>())
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>So now we can add some code to the <code>ContentView</code> to save and display the saved names. I am not going to use the <code>@FetchRequest</code> property wrapper as I feel that hides away what we are actually doing.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {

    <span class="keyword">let</span> storage: <span class="type">Storage</span>

    <span class="keyword">@State private var</span> personName: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>

    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">VStack</span> {
            <span class="type">TextField</span>(<span class="string">"Enter name"</span>, text: $personName)
                .<span class="call">padding</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">horizontal</span>)
            <span class="type">Button</span>(action: save,
                   label: { <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Save"</span>) })
            <span class="type">Spacer</span>()
        }
    }

    <span class="keyword">func</span> save() {
        <span class="keyword">if</span> !personName.<span class="property">isEmpty</span> {
            storage.<span class="call">savePerson</span>(with: personName)
            personName = <span class="string">""</span>
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>So we have added a TextField that captures a Person's name. If the name is not empty, and the Save button is pressed it will attempt to save the Person into the Core Data store. It then clears the TextField ready for the next entry.</p><p>Press CMD + R to build and run this on a simulator. You will see the following in the console when you press save.</p><p><code>Saved person named: Mike</code></p><p>But wait a minute, we cannot see what we have saved in to the Core Data store. Let's update our code so that we can see what we have entered.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> ContentView: <span class="type">View</span> {

    <span class="keyword">let</span> storage: <span class="type">Storage</span>

    <span class="keyword">@State private var</span> personName: <span class="type">String</span> = <span class="string">""</span>
    <span class="keyword">@State private var</span> people: [<span class="type">Person</span>] = []

    <span class="keyword">init</span>(storage: <span class="type">Storage</span>) {
        <span class="keyword">self</span>.<span class="property">storage</span> = storage
        _people = <span class="type">State</span>(initialValue: storage.<span class="call">fetchPeople</span>())
    }

    <span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
        <span class="type">VStack</span> {
            <span class="type">TextField</span>(<span class="string">"Enter name"</span>, text: $personName)
                .<span class="call">padding</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">horizontal</span>)
            <span class="type">Button</span>(action: save,
                   label: { <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Save"</span>) })
            <span class="type">List</span> {
                <span class="type">ForEach</span>(people) { person <span class="keyword">in</span>
                    <span class="type">Text</span>(person.<span class="property">name</span> ?? <span class="string">""</span>)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    <span class="keyword">func</span> save() {
        <span class="keyword">if</span> !personName.<span class="property">isEmpty</span> {
            storage.<span class="call">savePerson</span>(with: personName)
            personName = <span class="string">""</span>
            people = storage.<span class="call">fetchPeople</span>()
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>So we have added quite a lot to the <code>ContentView</code>. Firstly we added another state property for the array of Person objects that we plan to display. We have also added a custom initializer to the struct. The reason for this is we want to load the Person objects that we have stored when the view launches. We could do this with an <code>onAppear</code> modifier but I think it is better suited to the initializer. Note that we have to use <code>State(initialValue:)</code> to set the value on the people property, and that the people property is accessed via an underscore. This is something that we have to do when setting initial values for <code>@State</code>.</p><p>We have also added a list to our view. Notice that we are having to nil coalesce the value of name. This is because name is an optional String.</p><p>I know, I can hear you ask. Didn't we make name non-optional when we setup our Entity? Yes we did, you are correct. Firstly, it is non-optional for Core Data, however for Swift it is still an optional property. So to display it nicely we have to nil coalesce the value. We could write our own subclass of the managed object (rather than let Xcode handle it, like we did - that was the secret coding writing that Xcode did for us when we set up our entity) but that is beyond the scope of this post.</p><p>If you add the above code and CMD + R you should now see that the names you added before appear and any names you now add update the list.</p><p>But wouldn't it be nice to delete a row?</p><p>Well that is fairly straight forward. We just need to update our Storage class to have a delete function and add an onDelete method to the List in our ContentView.</p><p>As I mentioned before, we can make changes to our viewContext but they are not commited until we save it. So we can delete our Person object and then call save on the viewContext. Notice it is a similar approach that to that of saving a Person.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> deletePerson(<span class="keyword">_</span> person: <span class="type">Person</span>) {
    persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>.<span class="call">delete</span>(person)
    <span class="keyword">do</span> {
        <span class="keyword">try</span> persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>.<span class="call">save</span>()
    } <span class="keyword">catch</span> {
        persistentContainer.<span class="property">viewContext</span>.<span class="call">rollback</span>()
        <span class="call">print</span>(<span class="string">"Unable to delete person:</span> \(error)<span class="string">"</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>Next we have to update our ContentView. We add the following function to the ContentView</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> delete(offsets: <span class="type">IndexSet</span>) {
    <span class="keyword">for</span> index <span class="keyword">in</span> offsets {
        <span class="keyword">let</span> person = people[index]
        storage.<span class="call">deletePerson</span>(person)
    }
    people.<span class="call">remove</span>(atOffsets: offsets)
}
</code></pre><br /><p>We need to pass an IndexSet because that is what the modifier <code>onDelete(perform:)</code> gives us. We then loop over the index deleting each Person from the Core Data store, once we have done that we remove the Person object from the people array at the given offsets.</p><p>We now need to add the <code>onDelete(perform:)</code> modifer to our List. Here is the updated body of our ContentView.</p><br /><pre><code><span class="keyword">var</span> body: <span class="keyword">some</span> <span class="type">View</span> {
    <span class="type">VStack</span> {
        <span class="type">TextField</span>(<span class="string">"Enter name"</span>, text: $personName)
            .<span class="call">padding</span>(.<span class="dotAccess">horizontal</span>)
        <span class="type">Button</span>(action: save,
               label: { <span class="type">Text</span>(<span class="string">"Save"</span>) })
        <span class="type">List</span> {
            <span class="type">ForEach</span>(people) { person <span class="keyword">in</span>
                <span class="type">Text</span>(person.<span class="property">name</span> ?? <span class="string">""</span>)
            }
            .<span class="call">onDelete</span>(perform: delete)
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><br /><p>If you now build and run your project (CMD + R), you should be able to swipe to delete a row and it should update accordingly.</p><p>You should have something that looks like this:</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/o7jof2a.gif" title="Adding and deleting a person" /><br /><br /><p>Thanks for reading and I hope that you found this useful.</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>Copyright © Andrew Marmion 2021</p><div><a href="https://twitter.com/IamThatAndrew"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://github.com/andrewmarmion"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/andrewmarmion"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5508175/andrew?tab=profile"><i class="fa fa-stack-overflow"></i></a><a href="https://youtube.com/c/andrewmarmion"><i class="fa fa-youtube"></i></a></div></footer></body></html>
