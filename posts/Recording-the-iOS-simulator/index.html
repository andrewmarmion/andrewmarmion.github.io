You would need to use some specialist screen recording software: like Camtasia or QuickTime, or you would have to take a screenshot of your monitor and then crop it.</p><p>However these days are gone.</p><h1>Screenshots</h1><p>There are several ways to take a screenshot.</p><h2>Keyboard shortcut</h2><p>With the simulator selected, all you need to do is press <kbd>command ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> and it will take a screenshot.</p><h2>Snapshot button</h2><p>If you haven't looked closely at the simulator you may have missed this one. On the top of the window there is a camera. Just click that and it will take a screenshot.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XIP8BqU.png" title="Taking a screenshot with a the simulator button" /><h2>File menu</h2><p>With the simulator selected you can click <code>File</code> then <code>Save Screen</code> and it will take a screenshot.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xMQ35Dg.png" title="Taking a screenshot from the File menu on the simulator" /><h2>Terminal</h2><p>It is actually possible to take a screenshot from the terminal, making sure that you have the simulator running, open the terminal and type the following:</p><p><code>xcrun simctl io booted screenshot &lt;filename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;</code></p><p>This would usually be something like this</p><p><code>xcrun simctl io booted screenshot mySnapshot.png</code></p><br /><p>There are actually a few options that you can use with this:</p><p>For example if you would rather have <code>jpeg</code>s that <code>png</code>s you can set the type (the default is <code>png</code>):</p><p><code>--type=</code> and choose one of the following <code>bmp</code>, <code>gif</code>, <code>jpeg</code> or <code>png</code> For non-rectangular displays like the iPhone X you can apply a mask using:</p><p><code>--mask=</code> and then choosing <code>black</code>. This will take a screenshot with rounded corners and the notch.</p><h2>What do I use?</h2><p>In my day-to-day I use the keyboard short cut or the button on the simulator.</p><br /><hr><br /><h1>Recording</h1><p>Recording the screen has come along way from having to use external software. It can now be done in the simulator similarly to the screenshots.</p><h2>Keyboard shortcut</h2><p>With the simulator selected, all you need to do is press <kbd>command ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and it will take a screenshot.</p><h2>Record button</h2><p>There is a secret record button on the simulator. With the simulator selected, hold down the <kbd>option </kbd> and you will notice that the camera button changes at the top of the screen. Click that button to start recording, you can also click that button to stop recording.</p><video controls width="500">

If you right-click on that it will allow you to save the recording as an animated <code>gif</code>.</p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fPvluoC.png" title="Save the recording as a gif" /><h2>What do I use?</h2><p>Like the screenshot, I mostly use the keyboard shortcut or the simulator record button.</p><h1>Alternatives</h1><p>One alternative to using the simulator is to use a tool like <a href="https://www.rocketsim.app/">RocketSim</a>. This is a great little tool by <a href="https://www.avanderlee.com/">Antoine van der Lee/</a> and it supercharges the functionality of the simulator. I would recommend checking it out.</p><p>I actually use this at work, because it has the capability to show the touches on the screen. This makes sharing videos with stakeholders even easier, as where you tap is clearly highlighted. For this feature alone, it is worth its weight in gold.</p><p>I have been a user of this app since the Beta version, and have not received any incentive for writing the above.</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>Copyright © Andrew Marmion 2021</p><div><a href="https://twitter.com/IamThatAndrew" class="fa fa-twitter"></a><a href="https://github.com/andrewmarmion" class="fa fa-github"></a><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/andrewmarmion" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5508175/andrew?tab=profile" class="fa fa-stack-overflow"></a></div></footer></body></html>
