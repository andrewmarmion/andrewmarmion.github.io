In 2016 I decided to follow my passion for coding and changed careers. I completed a Master's in Software Engineering at the University of Stirling. Each module, and even my dissertation, were individually graded at a distinction level; giving me an overall distinction and making me the top student of my cohort.</p><p>I am passionate about learning and love acquiring new skills. At the moment my interests lie in making mobile applications, using native and cross-platform technologies. Though I have been known to dabble in backend technologies.</p><p>I volunteer at Codebase Stirling's biweekly Prewired event, helping to mentor new coders.</p><p>I was a technical editor on Daniel Steinberg's latest books on SwiftUI and functional programming, which can be purchased respectively on Gumroad <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/swiftuikickstart">here</a> and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/functionalKickstart">here</a>. I really recommend them as they are a fantastic resource.</p></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p>Copyright Â© Andrew Marmion 2020</p><div><a href="https://twitter.com/IamThatAndrew" class="fa fa-twitter"></a><a href="https://github.com/andrewmarmion" class="fa fa-github"></a><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/andrewmarmion" class="fa fa-linkedin"></a><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/5508175/andrew?tab=profile" class="fa fa-stack-overflow"></a></div></footer></body></html>
